# Publish an update of an ACA add-on (map add-on or content pack) from the command line.
# Jacob, 6 Nov: agents may run this whenever he asks for an add-on update; ACA, BBB and AiO
# still go through the console with him. The first version of an add-on is published by hand
# in Workbench (console options 9, 10, then 8 to record it).
#
# 1. Changelog: bullets already under the next version are kept; otherwise they are written
#    from the add-on's commit subjects since the live release, and committed.
# 2. Prepare: a fresh copy, startup-checked on a hidden server against the ACA and BBB copies
#    that are live on the Workshop (not the development source), so an add-on that needs an
#    unreleased ACA fails here instead of on players' machines.
# 3. Upload with Workbench's command line (version, changelog), confirmed from its log, then
#    recorded in WORKSHOP-RELEASES.json and the add-on's CHANGELOG (committed, not pushed).
# The Workshop page (description, pictures) is left as it is. -DryRun stops before the upload.
