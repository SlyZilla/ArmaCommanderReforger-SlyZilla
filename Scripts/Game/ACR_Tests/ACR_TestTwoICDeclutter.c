// -acrTwoICDeclutterTest 1 (server-capable, ~1 min): the 2IC UI's calmer look (#14 declutter, sketch
// boards 1-4; ACR_TwoICCompact), its logic without widgets. The channel: which lines need the player
// (a request it can't do yet, a FOB site with no truck) and that they stay pinned until answered;
// repeats merging with their time span; the newest 3 (5 on hover); the tool bar's count. The card's
// three lines and its pill. The FOB sites' one-line labels and cards, the cursor's one line, a card
// kept clear of the other sites. A sent truck's site label and a pinned suggestion's words.
// "Buy a truck" on the pinned no-truck line: refused while the side can't afford it (nothing bought,
// no RP spent, the reason on the line), bought through the requisition path otherwise (RP charged as
// the menu charges) at the deploying base nearest the FOB site, never by the 2IC itself; another
// waits until that truck has deployed; once it exists the line offers Send truck again.
